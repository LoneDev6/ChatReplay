# ChatReplay

ChatReplay replays the most recent chat-history when a player joins. This allows players to quickly catch-up on what happened in chat before they joined the server.
You can adapt the amount of messages replayed(/stored) in the configuration file.

This is my first plugin release. Feedback and pull requests are highly appreciated!
