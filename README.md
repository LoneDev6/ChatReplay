#ChatReplay
**ChatReplay replays the most recent chat-history when a player joins.**

This allows players to quickly catch-up on what happened in chat before they joined the server.
When hovering over the replayed messages in chat it shows a timestamp from when the messages have been sent.
You can adapt the amount of messages replayed(/stored in memory) in the configuration file.

*Note: Requires Spigot*
